# ts-workshop

## Introduction 🧩

This is a Agile Actors Typescript Material repo.

It's all about Typescript types and features as well as actually developing and growing through small exercises every step of the way! 💪

Enjoy learning TS ! 🎉🎉🎉

## Lesson setup 🛠️

All the lessons are split under the following convention;

`unique-name/src/*` where `\*` stands for exercise necessary initial, final and readme content.

- `initial` (starter file for user to write code in)
- `final` (final file for reference)
- `readme` (md file for exercise given)

***Note: that in order to start doing the exercise you should familiarise yourself with the concepts of the content near each `src` dir***
