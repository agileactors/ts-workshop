Exercise 1

In this exercise, you will use the 'as const' operator to enforce strict types and immutability in your code.

- Create an array of difficulty levels for a game ('easy', 'medium', 'hard'). Use 'as const' to ensure these levels are strictly typed. Then, create a variable that allows selecting only one of these difficulty levels.

- Create an object representing a book with properties like title: 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', author: 'J.K. Rowling', and publishedYear: 1998. Use 'as const' to make this object immutable and ensure its properties cannot be modified.

Exercise 2

Use the 'as const' operator to create a list of transport modes ('car', 'bike', 'train', 'plane'). Then, create a function that accepts only one of these modes as an argument and logs the selected mode.
